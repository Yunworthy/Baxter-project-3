# AprilTags

AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. I use AprilTag as a connection between kinect frame and baxter base, which is used in the extrinsic calibration.
There is a ros [package](https://github.com/RIVeR-Lab/apriltags_ros). which has a topic to publish the detected tag pose.

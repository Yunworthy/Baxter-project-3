# intrinsic and extrinsic calibration

In this project, I did a full calibration for Kinect sensor in order to let it join the Baxter base. The intrinsic calibration is to build connection between the RGB camera and ir sensor inside the Kinect V2. The extrinsic calibration is to get the pose of the Kinect origin inside the Baxter base coordinate system.

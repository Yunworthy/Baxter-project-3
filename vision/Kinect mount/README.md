In order to fix the Baxterv2 sensor, I design a mount and use 3D printing to build it. I have to say this mount is not perfect, because it does not restrict all degree of freedom (DOF), especially for the Kinect view angle, so I have to use some tapes to help me, and Kinect still has some interference with two limbs. However, I think it is enough to support this project. The interference only happenes when the arm is going to approach a target with very low Z coordinate value, and this motion is not what we are interested in, also that position is out of Kinect view range.
